TR-069 Server (NBN Specifications)

So far:

* a complete cycle of each session will configure an NBN UNI-V ATA port.
* assumptions are made about the topology, in my case: the LAN ip addresses are 10/8.

In your own version, you will need to set up:-
	$ACS_DSN    
	$ACS_DBHOST 
	$ACS_DBUSER 
	$ACS_DBPASS 
	$ACS_MCHOST 
	$ACS_SIP_SBC 
	$ACS_SIP_REG
